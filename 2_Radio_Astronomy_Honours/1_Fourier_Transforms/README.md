Fourier Transforms
==================

Some introductory Fourier Transforms ipython notebooks. Most of these notebooks were developed for the [NASSP](http://www.star.ac.za) honours course in Radio Astronomy.
(These notebooks are nbformat 2, from IPython version 0.12, due to the computer lab requirement of the NASSP course.)

The notebooks demonstrate:

1. Construction of a sine function out of sine components
2. Construction of a triangle wave function out of complex components
3. Introductory principles
4. An explicit DFT
5. Basic Fourier transform pairs
6. Doing a convolution from the definition
7. The convolution theorem
8. <coming>
9. Looking at Nyquist sampling in the Fourier domain
10. 2D Fourier transform examples
11. Signal processing intro
